# HTMLPractice
A simple repo to learn how to write HTML and arrange web layouts using CSS.

The final goal is to reproduce the look (and behavior) of another page: https://codepip.com/games/flexbox-froggy-pro/

Note how things change depending on the width of the page.

Also, the page doesn't always look the same way, because the games are randomly chosen. This means what I reproduce here might not be exactly what you see on the page, but the important bit is that it looks the same way.
